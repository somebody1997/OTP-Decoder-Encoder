## OTP-Decoder-Encoder
Welcome to the OTP-Decod-Encod project! This repository contains a C implementation of a simple yet powerful One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption and decryption program.

Overview
The One-Time Pad is an encryption technique that is considered unbreakable when used correctly. It uses a random key that is as long as the message being sent. This program demonstrates how to encode and decode messages using OTP in C.

### Features
- Encryption: Converts plaintext into ciphertext using a random key.
- Decryption: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext using the same key.
- Random Key Generation: Generates a random key for each encryption.
### Prerequisites
- C Compiler: Make sure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC.
- Make: Ensure make is available for building the project.
